    "## Introduction/Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In our time, cars are used for both leisure purposes and transport. By 2019, there were a car per two persons in the most of the developed countries while in some of them it is even more.  There are more and more cars on the roads as the demand increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the increase of cars on the roads, the accident probability increases. Prediction of car accidents and their severity is important to decrease deaths, injuries and damage to vehicles. With an accurate predictive tool, people may plan their travels accordingly to avoid accidents. So, building a model to predict probability and severity of an accident with influencing parameters is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Drivers and passangers are the primary stakeholders that would be interested in knowing accident probability to make their transportation plans. Additionally, insurance companies and public authorities would be interested in such a model to avoid loss of money due to damages and hospital costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, the data collected for Seattle city is used. The data includes all collisions provided by SPD and recorded by Traffic Records from 2004 to 2019. The dataset contains 7397574 entries for accident information with variable name of SEVERITY CODE and some related data such as location, road conditions etc in 38 columns (194673x38 table). The prediction will be done for SEVERITY CODE. First the attributes that will be used in the modeling will be selected and data will be prepared for model building. In my opinion, the attributes WEATHER, ROADCOND, LIGHTCOND are valuable for the prediction model. These attributes would mostly available for any time of the year; so, the model would work with their values. Also, some filtering might be done by using attributes such as UNDERINFL, which shows whether the driver was under influence of drugs etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final model, SEVERITY CODE is used as target while the attributes WEATHER describing the weather conditions during\n",
    "the time of the collision, ROADCOND showing the condition of the road during the collision and LIGHTCOND showing the light conditions during the collision are used as predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "INATTENTIONIND showing whether or not collision was due to inattention, UNDERINFL showing whether or not a driver involved was under the influence of drugs or alcohol and SPEEDING showing whether or not speeding was a factor in the collision are used in the data exploration step. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the data table consisting only the variables that are used in the model and exploratory step is created. SEVERITY CODE values of 0 (0 = unknown) are planned to be excluded from the analysis since they do noy provide any information on accident severity . It is observed that the only severity codes included in the initial data were 1 and 2; so, no exclusion was made by SEVERITY CODE. 9333 rows with SPEEDING answered yes, 5126 (entry Y) + 3995 (entry 1) = 9121 rows with UNDERINFL answered yes and 29805 rows with INATTENTIONIND answered yes are excluded to avoid person-related accidents. The final data frame has shape of 144089x4 excluding 3 columns (SPEEDING, INATTENTIONIND and UNDERINFL) used in the preparation step and null entries for predictory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Associations between the predictors between themselves and with target values are explored via using Cramer's V statistic since all variables are categorical. Moderate correlation between WEATHER and ROADCOND (0.48), and low correlation between WEATHER and LIGHTCOND (0.27) and between ROADCOND and LIGHTCOND (0.27) are found. None of the predictors are found to be highly correlated with target value (0.17-0.18 are the calculated correlation values). \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is a classification problem with two different output values for the target variable. Thus, classification methods are applied: KNN, decision trees, logistic regression and support vector machines. Before the method applications the dataset is divided into training (70%) and test sets (30%). The predictor variables are converted to dummy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "K nearest neighbors method gives best accuracy of 71.5% with k = 8. All methods are compared by using Jaccard score. There is no method which result in very good accuracy. KNN with k = 8 is selected as the final model with mean accuracy of about 50%.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictive model for accident severity using weather, road and light conditions provides good accuracy. The resulted model can be implemented in any algorithm used to calculate insurance rates. However, there should be some improvement of the model for low number of more severe accidents and maybe additional predictive variables. \n",
